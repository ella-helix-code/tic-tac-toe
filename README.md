# Tic Tac Toe App

This app was made with React and node.js and Cursor. 

I wanted to learn the basic structure of coding a web app, so I started with a simple tic tac toe file. I found 
the tutorial on React.com. I don't believe I recorded this file or my edits to it. This is my first repo on github and 
my first web app so I am learning the proper method and process of developing, which allows easy collaborations. In the 
future I am going to make regular commits and understand pushes so I have my full coding process on my repository. 

## Features

I started with the simple tic tac toe logic from a React Turtorial. I added features to this code as I began to understand it. 
        a. confetti after someone wins
        b. Reset Button 
        c. automatically reseting the game after their is a draw
        d. allowing the users to choose which icon to play with
        e. entering player name
        f. playing as single our double player
        g. adjusting the difficulty against AI
        h. on the game board screen having a settings button to change name, icon, and level

### Learning points

In future projects I am going to log my edits and commits better. This first project all about figuring out how to 
create an app with React and put it live. I didn't have a goal of logging what I did. I just wanted it done as it was 
my first one. With that said, in the future and on my next projects I want to record my process better. In addition I
want to be more organized and plan my process. The tic-tac-toe app was spontaneous and a curiosity project. Now that I 
understand React better, I will be more ogranized.
